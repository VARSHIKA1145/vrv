Here is an organized method for developing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface (UI) that manages users, roles, and permissions while meeting the assessment criteria and essential needs specified in your assignment.

Overview of the Proposed Design

1. Management of Users

User List View: Show a table containing the user's name, email address, role, and status.
Incorporate buttons for adding, editing, and removing users as actions.
Role Assignment: Users can be assigned roles directly within the table using a dropdown menu.
A switch to activate or deactivate user accounts is called a status toggle.
2. Management of Roles

Role List View: An independent area where all roles are listed along with the ability to add, edit, or remove roles.
Permissions by Role: Show a list of permissions (Read, Write, Delete) that can be turned on and off when modifying a role.
3. Adaptable Permissions

Permissions Dashboard: A specific page for permission management. Permissions can be changed dynamically, and each role can be chosen.
Clear Display: Use a table format to show roles and associated permissions, with options to edit directly.

Technical Execution

Framework for Frontends

Because of its popularity and component-based architecture, React is the best choice for creating the user interface.
UI Design Methodology

For responsive design and pre-built elements that improve visual appeal, use Material-UI or Bootstrap.
Install a sidebar for navigation on the dashboard (User Management, Role Management, Permissions).
Sample Code Structure:

/my-rbac-app
|-- /public
|-- /src
    |-- /components
        |-- UserList.js
        |-- RoleList.js
        |-- PermissionList.js
        |-- UserForm.js
        |-- RoleForm.js
    |-- /services
        |-- api.js
    |-- App.js
    |-- index.js
|-- package.json
|-- README.md



Implementation of Core Features

Component for User Management (User List.js)

Retrieve user information from the simulated API.
Display user information and actions in a table.
Use modal forms to add and edit users.
RoleList.js, a component for role management

Role-focused, but with a structure similar to User Management.
When modifying roles, make sure to include a permissions checklist.



PermissionList.js, a dynamic permissions component

Show roles and the permissions that go with them.
To enable dynamic permission modification, use checkboxes.
Simulation of an API (api.js)

To make API calls to the mock server, use Axios.
Handle error states and responses to give users feedback.
